Kennedy can also be referred to as 'The 35th president of the United States' or 'The U.S. president' or 'Senator J.F. Kennedy'.

So comparing them will be based on too few cases and thus not worthwile. Unfortunately the same thing goes for leaders and partners. While the data is valuable it is simply far beyond the scope of this project. If I had way more time I would try to extract the names out of these variables and run them through Wikipedia to categorize them. Was the leader a politician? A businessman? An actor? The same would go for opponents and partners. Are they a political party? Students? Police? But for now that is not possible unfortunately so we just keep the variables that already contain categorized data or can be converted into a simple yes/no and still be valuable."

If we look at this dataframe like we are making a recommender system for movies then the subjects (movements) are the users and the methods (of action) are the movies we try to recommend to the movements. So every method used by a movement now gets its own row. That also means that every method used gets the same score (the total score of the movement itself). Of course that score isn't directly meant for the method, but can still be useful. For example if using a 'mock funeral' as a method for a movement always leads to failure of the movement, mock funerals might not be the cause but there is still a reason to say: perhaps try to avoid this one and try a method that is more often involved in successful campaigns.\n",
