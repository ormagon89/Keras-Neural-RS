Sources do not offer any details about this violence. Considering this specific situation it is fair to assume that some degree of physical contact and confrontation between the workers and security guards took place but the researcher believes that it was not at a severe level. No one was hurt during those moments of campaigner and repressive violence. It is important to note that there is no evidence that suggests if this campaigner violence was sanctioned by the leadership or not. This was partly due to the fact that the workers' occupation was an instant decision after they were fired. There is a great chance that there was not a leadership developed or present when the campaign violence took place. However that is not to say that there was not a leadership at all. There is clear evidence of a leadership comprised of workers and union leaders presented at a later stage of the campaign.  It is probable that the leadership was developed after the initial takeover and during the occupation of the plants when the labor union Unite got involved."], "repressive violence": ["Riot police evicted Basildon occupiers following damage of administrative property.
